# Hey, Go Vote!

## Here's the idea:

I care about my community, but I routinely have no idea when local elections are
going to be. I thought it would be awesome if some twitter bot knew when
elections were coming up and would DM me to remind me that early voting starts
soon and maybe I should take a second to see what's on the ballot. So the plan
is to have a Twitter account (@[heygovote](http://twitter.com/heygovote)) that
people can follow. Based on the location field in their profile, it will try to
remind them about when elections are. In Texas, anyway (where I live), election
dates are set at the county level, so in general knowing what city someone lives
in should be close enough. It's a starting place.

## The Rules

There are some rules that Hey, Go Vote! must adhere to, in my mind, if anyone's
to trust it at all ever.

1. **Don't Ask For Information.** Lots of vote-reminder services ask for your
   address. This is because, in general, you have to know what house someone is
   in to tell which voting district they're in and you have to know which voting
   district they're in to be able to tell them what's going to be on their
   ballot. However, a lot of these tools ask for more contact information than
   they need so they can sell or give it to some political organization to
   pester you. FAIL. So Hey, Go Vote! will not ask for your address, your phone
   number or your email address.
2. **Impartial.** Speaking of political organizations, many of them make
   vote-reminder tools or other things designed to get people to the polls.
   However, they're often paired with some political messaging. I'm not
   interested in telling people how to vote. I just want to give them enough
   warning that they can spend the time to do their own research before voting.
   So HGV should remain politically neutral. Ideally any candidate should feel
   confident suggesting that voters sign up for it whether they're a Democrat, a
   Republican, a Communist or a member of the People's Party For Building a
   Zipline From The Moon to Pittsburg.
3. **Easy.** If this isn't easy as shit, no one will sign up. Period. Ideally,
   the sign up process should be just clicking the follow button on Twitter. Not
   "as easy as", but literally just clikcing that button.
